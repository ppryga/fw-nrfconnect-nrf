config AOA_LOCATOR_UART_PORT
	string "Name of the UART port"

config AOA_LOCATOR_DATA_SEND_WAIT_MS
	int "Number of miliseconds to wait after data is sent over UART."
	default 40
	range 1 100
	help
		The time to wait after a data packet is send.
		It is here because of the PC tool limitations,
		to give it a time for data processing before sending next packet.

config AOA_LOCATOR_PDDA_COARSE_STEP
	int "Step in degrees during coarse step of PDDA correlation"
	default 14
	range 1 30
	help
		The step in degrees in first PDDA correlation.
		First step is responsible for rough estimation of the angle.

config AOA_LOCATOR_PDDA_FINE_STEP
	int "Step in degrees during fine step of PDDA correlation"
	default 3
	range 0 30
	help
		The step in degrees in second PDDA correlation.
		Second step is responsible for fine estimation of the angle.
		If set to 0, no fine step is executed.
